    We have been pursuing <strong><u>right</u> education</strong> to make our student better person.
    Since our establishment, we have been constantly thinking about what the right education is.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px;">This is not necessarily limited to the subjects we teach, such as math or English, but about life and people.
    Beyond achieving good grades, our educational philosophy and mission is to enable our students to grow into more upright
    and just adults and have a positive impact on society.</p>
